<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# Connect 4

![alt text](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTv-4bDfk_YlC_i0OLlkbdDzW4w5kpUa3BQh3YQ2RHIZbvst9ibGbDKNZnxp1R7DF3LuXA&usqp=CAU)

Connect 4 is a game that is played by two players. Players choose between yellow or red discs. After deciding who will go first, the player inserts a disc from either end. The objective of the game is to have four matching discs in a row either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. The first player to accomplish that, wins!
